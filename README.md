Autonomous Driving Car using Deep Learning 
The prototype for self driving car is made using plastic chasis along with the dc motors and wheels. The chasis kept so that all the connections along with the raspberry pi connection.
1)Obstacle Detection- The Obstacle detection in Self Driving car can be achieved using ultra sonic sensor. The distance is fixed with the utrasonic sensor suppose for 30 cm the obstacle in front of the car between this range will be effective. The ultrasonic sensor is connected  with the arduino.
