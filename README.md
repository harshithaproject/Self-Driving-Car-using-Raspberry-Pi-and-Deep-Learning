Autonomous Driving Car using Deep Learning 
The prototype for self driving car is made using plastic chasis along with the dc motors and wheels. The chasis kept so that all the connections along with the raspberry pi connection.

1)Obstacle Detection- The Obstacle detection in Self Driving car can be achieved using ultra sonic sensor. The distance is fixed with the utrasonic sensor suppose for 30 cm the obstacle in front of the car between this range will be effective. The ultrasonic sensor is connected  with the arduino.

2)Advanced Lane Detection- The advanced lane detection is done using Ross Kippenbrock Method in which the curved roads are also detected with accracy based on the white lanes on the road. The sliding window approach makes the kippen brock method more effective. The histogram analysis is made continuously so that the peaks and the lanes are maintained properly. FOr advanced lane Detection the web camera is attached in front of the car for continuous video processing.

3) YOLO object Detection- The YOLO object detection is better than other region based algorithms. For YOLO object detection the videos are taken frame by frame
